# Trabalhando com Machine Learning na Pr√°tica no Azure ML



Explore Automated Machine Learning in Azure ML
==============================================

In this exercise, you‚Äôll use the automated machine learning feature in Azure Machine Learning to train and evaluate a machine learning model. You‚Äôll then deploy and test the trained model.

This exercise should take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

> **Note** To complete this lab, you will need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative access.

Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
------------------------------------------

To use Azure Machine Learning, you need to provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace in your Azure subscription. Then you‚Äôll be able to use Azure Machine Learning studio to work with the resources in your workspace.

> **Tip**: If you already have an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can use that and skip to the next task.

1.  Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com` using your Microsoft credentials.
    
2.  Select **\+ Create a resource**, search for _Machine Learning_, and create a new **Azure Machine Learning** resource with the following settings:
    *   **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_.
    *   **Resource group**: _Create or select a resource group_.
    *   **Name**: _Enter a unique name for your workspace_.
    *   **Region**: _Select the closest geographical region_.
    *   **Storage account**: _Note the default new storage account that will be created for your workspace_.
    *   **Key vault**: _Note the default new key vault that will be created for your workspace_.
    *   **Application insights**: _Note the default new application insights resource that will be created for your workspace_.
    *   **Container registry**: None (_one will be created automatically the first time you deploy a model to a container_).
3.  Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**. Wait for your workspace to be created (it can take a few minutes), and then go to the deployed resource.
    
4.  Select **Launch studio** (or open a new browser tab and navigate to [https://ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com?azure-portal=true), and sign into Azure Machine Learning studio using your Microsoft account). Close any messages that are displayed.
    
5.  In Azure Machine Learning studio, you should see your newly created workspace. If not, select **All workspaces** in the left-hand menu and then select the workspace you just created.

Enable preview features
-----------------------

Some features of Azure Machine Learning are in preview, and need to be explicitly enabled in your workspace.

1.  In Azure Machine Learning Studio, click on **manage preview features** (the loud speaker icon - üï´).   
  
    
2.  Enable the following preview feature:
    
    *   _Guided experience for submitting training jobs with serverless compute_

Use automated machine learning to train a model
-----------------------------------------------

Automated machine learning enables you to try multiple algorithms and parameters to train multiple models, and identify the best one for your data. In this exercise, you‚Äôll use a dataset of historical bicycle rental details to train a model that predicts the number of bicycle rentals that should be expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological features.

4.  Wait for the job to finish. It might take a while ‚Äî now might be a good time for a coffee break!
    

Review the best model
---------------------

When the automated machine learning job has completed, you can review the best model it trained.

1.  On the **Overview** tab of the automated machine learning job, note the best model summary. 
    
    > **Note** You may see a message under the status ‚ÄúWarning: User specified exit score reached‚Ä¶‚Äù. This is an expected message. Please continue to the next step.
    
2.  Select the text under **Algorithm name** for the best model to view its details.
    
3.  Select the **Metrics** tab and select the **residuals** and **predicted\_true** charts if they are not already selected.
    
    Review the charts which show the performance of the model. The **residuals** chart shows the _residuals_ (the differences between predicted and actual values) as a histogram. The **predicted\_true** chart compares the predicted values against the true values.
    

Deploy and test the model
-------------------------

1.  On the **Model** tab for the best model trained by your automated machine learning job, select **Deploy** and use the **Web service** option to deploy the model with the following settings:
    *   **Name**: predict-rentals
    *   **Description**: Predict cycle rentals
    *   **Compute type**: Azure Container Instance
    *   **Enable authentication**: _Selected_
2.  Wait for the deployment to start - this may take a few seconds. The **Deploy status** for the **predict-rentals** endpoint will be indicated in the main part of the page as _Running_.
3.  Wait for the **Deploy status** to change to _Succeeded_. This may take 5-10 minutes.

Test the deployed service
-------------------------

Now you can test your deployed service.

1.  In Azure Machine Learning studio, on the left hand menu, select **Endpoints** and open the **predict-rentals** real-time endpoint.
    
2.  On the **predict-rentals** real-time endpoint page view the **Test** tab.
    
3.  In the **Input data to test endpoint** pane, replace the template JSON with the following input data:
    
         {
           "Inputs": { 
             "data": [
               {
                 "day": 1,
                 "mnth": 1,   
                 "year": 2022,
                 "season": 2,
                 "holiday": 0,
                 "weekday": 1,
                 "workingday": 1,
                 "weathersit": 2, 
                 "temp": 0.3, 
                 "atemp": 0.3,
                 "hum": 0.3,
                 "windspeed": 0.3 
               }
             ]    
           },   
           "GlobalParameters": 1.0
         }
        
    
4.  Click the **Test** button.
    
5.  Review the test results, which include a predicted number of rentals based on the input features - similar to this:
    
         {
           "Results": [
             444.27799000000000
           ]
         }
        
    
    The test pane took the input data and used the model you trained to return the predicted number of rentals.
    

Let‚Äôs review what you have done. You used a dataset of historical bicycle rental data to train a model. The model predicts the number of bicycle rentals expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological _features_.

Clean-up
--------

The web service you created is hosted in an _Azure Container Instance_. If you don‚Äôt intend to experiment with it further, you should delete the endpoint to avoid accruing unnecessary Azure usage.

1.  In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com?azure-portal=true), on the **Endpoints** tab, select the **predict-rentals** endpoint. Then select **Delete** and confirm that you want to delete the endpoint.
    
    Deleting your compute ensures your subscription won‚Äôt be charged for compute resources. You will however be charged a small amount for data storage as long as the Azure Machine Learning workspace exists in your subscription. If you have finished exploring Azure Machine Learning, you can delete the Azure Machine Learning workspace and associated resources.
    

To delete your workspace:

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
2.  Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.
